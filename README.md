# Recommandation-System
The goal of this project is to improve the performance of a recommendation-system by using non-trivial algorithms and by performing hyper-parameters tuning.

Using data relative to movie ratings of users, we apply all algorithms for recommendation made available by [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/) libraries, according to their default configuration.
